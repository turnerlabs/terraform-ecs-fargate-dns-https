# terraform-ecs-fargate-dns-https

A `fargate-create` compatible Terraform template that spins up HTTPS applications with DNS and TLS certificates.

This will give you a running endpoint with the following format:
```
https://${environment}.${app}.${domain}
```

Note that this assumes that the route53 zone for the domain is in the same account and you have access to create records.

The templates are designed to be customized.  The optional components can be removed by simply deleting the `.tf` file.

The templates are used for managing infrastructure concerns and, as such, the templates deploy a [default backend docker image](env/dev/ecs.tf#L26).  We recommend using the [fargate CLI](https://github.com/turnerlabs/fargate) for managing application concerns like deploying your actual application images and environment variables on top of this infrastructure.  The fargate CLI can be used to deploy applications from your laptop or in CI/CD pipelines.

## Components

### base

These components are shared by all environments.

| Name | Description | Optional |
|------|-------------|:---:|
| [main.tf][bm] | AWS provider, output |  |
| [state.tf][bs] | S3 bucket backend for storing Terraform remote state  |  |
| [ecr.tf][be] | ECR repository for application (all environments share)  |  ||

### env/dev

These components are for a specific environment. There should be a corresponding directory for each environment
that is needed.

| Name | Description | Optional |
|------|-------------|:----:|
| [main.tf][edm] | Terrform remote state, AWS provider, output |  |
| [ecs.tf][ede] | ECS Cluster, Service, Task Definition, ecsTaskExecutionRole, CloudWatch Log Group |  |
| [lb.tf][edl] | ALB, Target Group, S3 bucket for access logs  |  |
| [nsg.tf][edn] | NSG for ALB and Task |  |
| [lb-https.tf][edlhttps] | HTTPS listener, NSG rule, DNS entry, HTTPS Certificate | Yes |
| [dashboard.tf][edd] | CloudWatch dashboard: CPU, memory, and HTTP-related metrics | Yes |
| [role.tf][edr] | Application Role for container | Yes |
| [cicd.tf][edc] | IAM user that can be used by CI/CD systems | Yes |
| [autoscale-perf.tf][edap] | Performance-based auto scaling | Yes |
| [autoscale-time.tf][edat] | Time-based auto scaling | Yes |
| [logs-logzio.tf][edll] | Ship container logs to logz.io | Yes |
| [secretsmanager.tf][edsm] | Add a base secret to Secretsmanager | Yes |
| [ecs-event-stream.tf][ees] | Add an ECS event log dashboard | Yes |


## Usage

Typically, the base Terraform will only need to be run once, and then should only
need changes very infrequently. After the base is built, each environment can be built.

```
# Move into the base directory
$ cd base

# Sets up Terraform to run
$ terraform init

# Executes the Terraform run
$ terraform apply

# Now, move into the dev environment
$ cd ../env/dev

# Sets up Terraform to run
$ terraform init

# Executes the Terraform run
$ terraform apply
```

##### Important (after initial `terraform apply`)

The generated base `.tfstate` is not stored in the remote state S3 bucket. Ensure the base `.tfstate` is checked into your infrastructure repo. The default Terraform `.gitignore` [generated by GitHub](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Terraform.gitignore) will ignore all `.tfstate` files; you'll need to modify this!

## fargate-create

Alternatively you can use the [fargate-create CLI](https://github.com/turnerlabs/fargate-create) to scaffold new projects based on this template.

install
```shell
curl -s get-fargate-create.turnerlabs.io | sh
```

create an input vars file (`terraform.tfvars`)
```hcl
app = "myapp"
environment = "dev"
domain = "foo.turnerlabs.io"

region = "us-east-1"
aws_profile = "default"
saml_role = "myrole"

tags = {
  application   = "myapp"
  environment   = "dev"
  team          = "myteam"
  customer      = "mycustomer"
  contact-email = "me@email.com"
}

container_port = "8080"
health_check = "/health"

vpc = "vpc-123456789"
private_subnets = "subnet-abc,subnet-123"
public_subnets = "subnet-def,subnet-456"
```

```shell
$ fargate-create -t git@github.com:turnerlabs/terraform-ecs-fargate-dns-https
```
